0.900001_03 2010-02-18
    - Journal schema is now in it's own virtual package instead of being in
      DBIx::Class::Schema::Journal::DB so a user should be able to have
      multiple journals without them mingling
    - No longer depend on Test::TempDir so this should build on windows
    - Use Class::C3::Componentised instead of DBIx::Class::Componentised
    - Fixed syntax error in SYNOPSIS
    - Lots of cleanup (deleting unused files, commented out code, etc)
    - Switched to Module::Install instead of EU::MM

    - The one time I forget to run disttest, the MANIFEST file mysteriously
      disappears... *sigh*

0.900001_01
    - insert records a history row as well
    - SQL::Translator is required to run the test suite
    - Add EvalWrap subclass, that suppressed errors and warns instead, useful
      for when having no errors is preferable over partial journal data
    - various refactoring
    - correct journalling of recreated data (data with a primary key that
      previously existed)
    - update to DBIx::Class's versioning scheme

    - deployment at connect time is disabled by default, set journal_auto_deploy to reenable
    - $main_schema->deploy deploys the journalling tables too
    - support multi column primary keys
    - rename Change to ChangeLog to avoid conflict with mysql reserved word
    - fix schema composition when sharing connection
    - support for nested transactions (produce one changeset, but support stubs
      for nested changesets in place)
    - removed dummy table
    - various other cleanups
    - calling current_changeset outside of txn_do is fatal
    - fix 'now()' default value, timestamp happens in perl space instead
    - also call txn_do on the journal schema if the storage object differs
    - don't call txn_begin twice
